The Tower of Hanoi, is a mathematical problem which consists of three rods and multiple disks.
Initially, all the disks are placed on one rod, one over the other in ascending order of size similar to a cone-shaped tower.

The objective of this problem is to move the stack of disks from the initial rod to another rod, following these rules:

1-A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk
2-No disk can be placed on top of the smaller disk.
